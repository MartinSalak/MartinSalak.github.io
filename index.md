## Welcome 
Greetings, my name is Martin Salak, and I am a doctoral candidate at the Faculty of Civil Engineering within the Czech Technical University in Prague. As part of my academic pursuits, I dedicate half of my time to furthering my studies, while the other half is spent in professional practice. Welcome to my website, where I aim to showcase my work and accomplishments.

 
## Me
_As a structural engineer, I am passionate about advancing our industry's practices and processes. From hands-on work with cement to coding in Python._

Growing up in Prague, I was surrounded by beautiful architecture that sparked my interest in the field. However, as I began to explore more diverse styles and structures, such as the Chrysler Building in New York and the Forth Bridge in Scotland (which used to be my favourite structures as a kid), my fascination with Structural Engineering grew.

During my university years, I was fortunate to be part of Professor Stemberk's group, where I had the freedom to pursue projects that both challenged and excited me. For my master's thesis, I designed a concrete bridge model, which is described in more detail on my [Masters page](Masters.md). Currently, I am pursuing my PhD under Professor Stemberk's guidance, and my research interests are outlined on my [PhD page](PhD.md).

As a junior structural engineer, I gained valuable experience for two years before joining SCIA in 2021 as a Functional Analyst. In this role, I help develop software that benefits Structural Engineers.

Outside of work, I have a passion for hiking and spending time in nature, which stems from my years as a Boy Scout. I also enjoy playing sports, including volleyball, football, and skiing, and I am an avid Magic the Gathering player. Above all, I cherish spending time with my family.
